Hi! I'm Mita Williams. I'm a librarian at the University of Windsor
and I have an undergraduate degree in Geography & Environmental Science and
I'm currently on sabbatical researching web mapping and "in the field" information seeking.

### Slide 2

When we search for information through Google Maps, 
we are drawn a map that favours the commerical over the civic.
The top hit for playgrounds walkerville is Maxine's Adult Playground

### Slide 3

The city of windsor doesn't use Google - they use a powerful software suite called a Geographic Information System
But the power of that system is for those who work at the city. We just get a view of the maps they create

### Slide 4

That last map came from the recently released Cultural Mapping Project from the City
which I think is worth reading especially for its cultural employment summary of the city

### Slide 5

The project produced a number of map apps like this one of Community Cultural Organizations
But while the project report gives analysis, the maps themselves don't really lend themselves telling a story

### Slide 6

GIS maps allow users to assemble our own maps from layers of information which can be great
But that doesn't mean that pre-assembled maps, like this one of bike trails, still aren't useful

### Slide 7

One of the reasons why Google Maps is so popular is that it allows all of us to make our own maps
This is the Ford City Community Map - which doesn't look too different than the City GIS produced one

### Slide 8

There are a variety of other web services that make the mashing up of google maps easier.
Here's another example: recently some University of Windsor History students added images to History Pin

### Slide 9

And a third example which uses something called Zeemap
The Olde Walkerville Residents Association surveyed the missing trees from the neighbourhood
and this map does a very good of conveying the scale of how many are 'missing'

### Slide 10

Maps do more than just help us explore - maps can tell very powerful stories. 
This infamous map of downtown Detroit from 1968 is called Where Commuters Run Over Black Children.
It higlights much more than a lack of playgrounds in the downtown

### Slide 11

I'm interested in how web mapping allow those in the community to make our own maps 
I've noticed that Wikipedia now has longitude and latitudes points for many of its entries

### Slide 12
image from: http://inkdroid.org/ici/
				        
Open data plus open standards means that new kinds of new maps can be built without GIS or Google
This is a website called ici that tells you which things are nearby that have been geocoded in wikipedia

### Slide 13

Here's a map of the Windsor Sculpture Garden. Except its in a game called Ingress
All the sculptures are portals that are fought over and captured for territory between two rival factions 

### Slide 14

Here's another map of bike trails in Windsor. Except the trails aren't drawn by hand
These are trails made by the GPS tracks by those using the Strava app

### Slide 15

Strava chooses not to spend money on the high licensing fees set by Google to make use of its maps
It uses the Wikipedia of Maps called OpenStreetMap: I added most of the features of the UW campus to it here

### Slide 16
image from: http://ruebot.net/yudl-leaflet.html
				        
This map from York University also uses OpenStreetMap and make browsing a digital collection more intuitive
I don't have to search all the names of the places that are near where I live

### Slide 17
image from: http://www.citywindsor.ca/opendata/pages/open-data-catalogue.aspx
				        
There can't be ONE map for all the uses we have in the world.
That's why I am thankful that the City of Windsor for sharing some of its map data 
for all of us to use and reuse in its Open data Catalogue

### Slide 18

I just happen to be lead of the a group called Open Data Windsor Essex
We've recently received Trillium funding to help nonprofit organizations organize and host 
open data to share with others in the community.

### Slide 19

I'm hoping to be able to make wonderful web maps with the data we collect: 
hopefully with info about food, bicycles and art
Because we can make and share maps that are more than just push pins
