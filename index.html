				        Hi! I'm Mita Williams. I'm a librarian at the University of Windsor
				        and I have an undergraduate degree in Geography & Environmental Science and
				        I'm currently on sabbatical researching web mapping and "in the field" information seeking.

				        When we search for information through Google Maps, 
				        we are drawn a map that favours the commerical over the civic.
				        The top hit for playgrounds walkerville is Maxine's Adult Playground

				        The city of windsor doesn't use Google - they use a powerful software suite called a Geographic Information System
				        But the power of that system is for those who work at the city. We just get a view of the maps they create

				        That last map came from the recently released Cultural Mapping Project from the City
				        which I think is worth reading especially for its cultural employment summary of the city

				        The project produced a number of maps like this one of Community Cultural Organizations
				        But these maps themselves don't really lend themselves to analysis or tell a story

				        GIS maps allow users to assemble our own maps from layers of information which can be great
				        But that doesn't mean that pre-assembled maps, like this one of bike trails, still aren't useful

				        One of the reasons why Google Maps is so popular is that it allows all of us to make our own maps
				        This is the Ford City Community Map - which doesn't look too different than the City one

				        There are a variety of websites that make the mashing up of google maps easier.
				        Here's another example: recently some UofW History students added images to History Pin

				        And a third example:
				        The Olde Walkerville Residents Association surveyed the missing trees from the neighbourhood
				        and this map does a good of conveying the scale of how many are 'missing'

				        Maps do more than just help us explore - maps can tell very powerful stories. 
				        This infamous map of downtown Detroit from 1968 is called Where Commuters Run Over Black Children

				        Strava chooses not to buy the high licensing fees set by Google to make its maps

				        There can't be ONE map for some many uses in the world.
				        That's why I am thankful that the City of Windsor for sharing some of its map data

				        By the way, I'm the lead of the a group called Open Data Windsor Essex

				        I'm hoping to be able to make wonderful web maps with the data we collect: 
				        hopefully with info about food, bicycles and art
				        Because we can make and share maps that are >more than just push pins
